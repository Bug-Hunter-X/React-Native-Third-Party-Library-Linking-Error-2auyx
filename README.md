# React Native Third-Party Library Linking Error

This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle issue in React Native development: linking errors with third-party libraries, specifically those with native module dependencies (iOS and Android).  Failure to properly link these modules often results in runtime crashes or the absence of expected functionality.

## Bug Description
When integrating a native module library (e.g., for camera access or geolocation), the project might fail to build or exhibit unexpected behavior if the native code isn't correctly linked. The symptoms can include:

*   **Build failures:** Errors during compilation due to missing native dependencies.
*   **Runtime crashes:** The app crashes when trying to access the library's functionality.
*   **Missing functionality:** The functionality provided by the library simply isn't available.

This example uses a hypothetical camera library for illustrative purposes.

## How to Reproduce
1.  Clone this repository.
2.  (Simulate the bug) Try running the app without correctly linking the native camera library (the steps would vary depending on the library).
3.  Observe the errors or missing features.

## Solution
Correctly link the native modules according to the library's documentation.  This typically involves using tools like `react-native link` (if supported by the library) or manual configuration within the native iOS and Android project files (Android's `settings.gradle`, `build.gradle`, and iOS's `Podfile`).
