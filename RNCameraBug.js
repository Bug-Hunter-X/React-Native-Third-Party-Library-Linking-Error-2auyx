This error occurs when you are using a third party library that hasn't been correctly linked or configured within your React Native project. This often happens with native modules that require platform-specific code (iOS and Android).  Symptoms might include build failures, runtime crashes, or missing functionality. For example, consider a library for camera access. If the native code isn't properly linked, the app might crash when trying to use the camera or not show the camera view at all.
