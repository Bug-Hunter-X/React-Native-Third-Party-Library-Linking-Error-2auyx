The solution involves ensuring that the native modules of the third-party library are correctly linked to your React Native project.  The specific steps will vary depending on the library, but commonly involve these actions:

1. **Check Library Documentation:** Always refer to the library's official documentation for its linking instructions.  Each library might have a different process.
2. **Using `react-native link`:** Some libraries support the `react-native link` command. Try it after installing the library using npm or yarn. 
3. **Manual Linking:** If `react-native link` isn't sufficient or available, you'll need to manually update the native Android and iOS project files. This generally entails:
    * **Android:**  Modifying files like `settings.gradle` (to include the library's module), `build.gradle` (adding dependencies), and potentially the `AndroidManifest.xml`.
    * **iOS:**  Updating the `Podfile` and running `pod install` to integrate the native iOS components. 
4. **Clean and Rebuild:** After making linking changes, clean your project and rebuild it.   
5. **Example (Illustrative):** 

While this example doesn't showcase the entire linking process, it highlights the importance of verifying the steps outlined in the specific library's documentation.  Incorrect or incomplete linking is the most common cause of this type of error.
